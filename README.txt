In addition to the well documented code itself, each GROUP needs to
create a README.TXT that briefly describes the structure of the code,
how to play it, and any credits that need to be attributed. Each GROUP
also needs to generate an approximately 30 second movie clip and 3 still
images showing the best elements of their game. These items should be
zipped with the code and submitted through Blackboard. (25 points)
