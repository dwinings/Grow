Fire that destroys grass
Building on this, if fire kills grass, then the player can't grow on 100% of the tiles.  As such,
what if we simply have a % completion for moving to the next level, and one (or more) exit tiles.
On top of this system, we could have a rating system (1-3) stars.  Getting the minimum %, say, 65%, allows
you to exit the level through an exit, but only earns you 1 star.  85% - 2 stars, 95%>, 3 stars.
The player's score is saved, and the player can choose to play previous levels for a higher score.
Could have aesthetic unlockables based on number of stars earned. (10 stars to buy angry-face Grow).

Grow could consume different materials to change his state.  Absorbing some acid could allow it to burn its way through more fragile walls,
while absorbing gelatin would allow Grow to bounce.
