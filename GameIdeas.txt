 Fire that destroys grass
Building on this, if fire kills grass, then the player can't grow on 100% of the tiles.  As such,
what if we simply have a % completion for moving to the next level, and one (or more) exit tiles.
On top of this system, we could have a rating system (1-3) stars.  Getting the minimum %, say, 65%, allows
you to exit the level through an exit, but only earns you 1 star.  85% - 2 stars, 95%>, 3 stars.
The player's score is saved, and the player can choose to play previous levels for a higher score.
Could have aesthetic unlockables based on number of stars earned. (10 stars to buy angry-face Grow).
