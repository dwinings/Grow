Level titles 
Dying resets the level
Blocks that are also affected by gravity 
 - Add a boolean to prevent blocks changing player gravity

Hazards, not enemies
-Dripping lave/fire
-- Drips on a time
-- can kill you 
- More?

These are good, but they need tradeoffs
- Acid State: Absorbing some acid could allow it to burn its way through more fragile walls,
- Gelatin State: absorbing gelatin would allow Grow to bounce.


Levels can have a possible exit, obtained by going to it once you reach a set growth %



Repulsor blocks
- Maybe, but not necessarily a good fit for the game
- blocks that push you away 

Objects that can affect the world on time based 



Make block files global

 Fire that destroys grass
Building on this, if fire kills grass, then the player can't grow on 100% of the tiles.  As such,
what if we simply have a % completion for moving to the next level, and one (or more) exit tiles.
On top of this system, we could have a rating system (1-3) stars.  Getting the minimum %, say, 65%, allows
you to exit the level through an exit, but only earns you 1 star.  85% - 2 stars, 95%>, 3 stars.
The player's score is saved, and the player can choose to play previous levels for a higher score.
Could have aesthetic unlockables based on number of stars earned. (10 stars to buy angry-face Grow).
--This would be more for a platformer... this is a puzzle game. You either solve a puzzle or you don't. The only 
real variable should be the time it took to solve the puzzle, but that idea has been done to death.

-If we have spare development time, I think.
