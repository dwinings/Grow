Fire that destroys grass
Building on this, if fire kills grass, then the player can't grow on 100% of the tiles.  As such,
what if we simply have a % completion for moving to the next level, and one (or more) exit tiles.
Building on this, we could have a rating system (1-3) stars.  Getting the minimum %, say, 65%, allows
you to exit the level through an exit, but only earns you 1 star.  85% - 2 stars, 95%>, 3 stars.



Enemies:
- vicious plant that will attack you after you grow them, visually show - this with look like red dirt 

Levels can have a possible exit, obtained by going to it once you reach a set growth %

Blocks that are also affected by gravity 

Repulsor blocks
- blocks that push you away 

Vines 
- ladders (if player is holding F)
